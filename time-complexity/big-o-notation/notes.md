## Big O Notation
 - Big O represents a boundary for the worst case scenario 
 
 - For loops are an example od an n in a situation, or O(n) because we are only computing one value
  - Nesting a for loop inside of another for loop is an example of n^2
  - For each nested loop inside another loop you add +1 to log(n*log)
  
   - _Example Question:_
    For each data "n" in a data list check id "w" is in the data list. if n=w print true.
