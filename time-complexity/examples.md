if every cycle of a program takes .001 seconds how much faster is nlog(n) than n^2?

* if 1000 pieces of data are input
  - nlogn = 1000log(1000) = 9960 * .001 = 9.96 seconds
  - n^2 = 1000^2 = 1,000,000 * .001  = 16 meaning
  
* if 25,000 piece of data to input 
  - nlogn = 25,000log(25,000) = 365,000 * .001 = 6 min 5 seconds
  - n^2 = 25,000^2 = 625,000,000 * .001 = ~7 days 5 hours
